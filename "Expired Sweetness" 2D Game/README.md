Expired Sweetness is a third-person 2D Action / Adventure game inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with a hint of drama and action. 

You play as Tootsie Mike, a millionaire who runs a multi-million-dollar candy company. Ever since you inherited “Sweet World” (your company’s name), everything has always been smooth sailing. Your employees have always been loyal ever since your father built the company. These small yet cheerful little “dumplings” always did their work on time and never skipped a day. 

Yet one day, a few disgruntled employees release expired candy furious at you for paying your workers solely in candy. Claiming they have no way of supporting their family with just chocolate bars. The audacity.... This candy, “Yum Tum”, when left expired, creates a chemical reaction forming the infectious disease called “Mad Tum Disease”. It is up to you to find all the poisonous / expired candy and dispose of them correctly. Not only that but your final main objective is to retrieve the vaccine needed for this virus. Be wary of the disgruntled employees, as they’re your enemy. You will find friends and foes in this quest; the entire fate of the world will be in your hands.

### Game Rules
The game is a closed environment set in Sweet World’s factory. The player, who controls Tootsie Mike (the main character), will be able to use a sword placed inside the game. The user will also be able to pick up the expired sweets and be able to dispose of them. The total amount of expired candies scattered throughout the game level is 10. There are also two types of NPCs, friendly NPCs and enemy NPCs. The friendly NPCs will help and guide you along the way, while the enemy NPCs are out to make sure you don’t make it to the vaccine.

Not only that, the difficulty of the game increases as you continue on throughout the level. The entirety of the bottom floor consists of spikes which can ultimately end the game for the player, causing them to restart from the beginning. As the player progresses, more platforms will start to move as well, one wrong slip and they’re all the way back at square 1. This causes the player to be more cautious and slow down.
